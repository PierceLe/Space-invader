Command gradle build run to run my project.

In this Assignment, I implemented all of 3 features.

Firstly, Singleton design was used in my assignment located in folder namely singleton. The folder includes 1 java java namely DifficultChooser.java . Secondly, Observer pattern was used to make time, and score available to update.The observer pattern is included in observer folder including 4 files namely Observe.java, ScoreObserver.java, TimeObserver.java, Subject.java, and TimeScore.java. Finally, memento was used in order to make undo functionality included in memento folder which includes 3 files namely Caretaker.java, Memento.java, and Originator.java.

Marker can choose difficulty level, undo, or cheat by pressing on buttons I designed on game window.

For choosing difficulty levels, the current game window will currently disappear when player presses change difficulty. The player can choose the level, and press "Start Game" again to play the game.
